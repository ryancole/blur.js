This is a Javascript library that was posted on Hacker News (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3682365). I do not know who wrote it or what the license is. The code was not on Github. The code was also terribly unreadable and slow. I have taken the liberty of adding the code to Github and am trying to speed it up.
